# MachineLearningOmega
Team-project of the machine learning lecture in the Fall Semester 22' at Ewha. Team Omega 

## Dataset
The original dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/hainescity/company-s-ideal-customers


The final dataset is "finalDataSet.csv", which is already preproccessed.
- With "datasetPreprocessing.ipynb" preprocessing has been applied to the original data

## Oversampled Dataset
The oversampled data set is split into the train set "train_oversampled.csv" and the test set "test_set.csv"
- With "ApplyOversampling.ipynb" oversampling has been applied to the finalDataSet.csv

## Choosing the right model
Please Follow these steps to reach the results:

1. Open Models.ipynb

2. Adjust file path in for three data: (finalalDataSet.csv, test_set, tain_oversampled)

3. Run all code cell to see the results.
